Giraffez is a client library for `Teradata <http://www.teradata.com/>`_, made to be fast and user-friendly. It shares many features with the official Teradata tools, but makes them available in an easy-to-use command-line interface and Python API.


Features
########

- `Command-line tool <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html>`_
- `Python API <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/api.html#giraffez-modules>`_ - expressive, powerful, and great for `working with other packages <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/api.html#working-with-other-packages>`_ (e.g. `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`_)
- `Execute <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#cmd>`_ SQL statements using the Teradata CLIv2 library -- performing ad hoc queries and commands
- `Insert <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#insert>`_ into existing Teradata tables using the CLIv2 drivers
- `Archive <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#archiving>`_ Teradata tables to save space. These can easily be `transformed to flatfiles <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#fmt>`_ or `loaded <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#load>`_ back into Teradata
- `BulkExport <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#export>`_ from Teradata to a flatfile or archival format, retaining data type information
- `BulkLoad <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#load>`_ into existing Teradata tables using the Teradata PT Update (MLOAD)
- `Config <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#config>`_ - manage connection information and credentials securely using the ``giraffez config`` and ``giraffez secret`` commands
- `Interactive shell <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#shell>`_ for executing Teradata queries -- much like BTEQ, but with a friendly interface
- `Run <https://capitalone.github.io/giraffez/command-line.html#run>`_ job files in YAML format
